            "abstract": "This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a user-verification system for a smart gun, which is based on grip-pattern recognition. An existing pressure sensor consisting of an array of 44 \u00d7 44 piezoresistive elements is used to measure the grip pattern. An interface has been developed to acquire pressure images from the sensor. The values of the pixels in the pressure-pattern images are used as inputs for a verification algorithm, which is currently implemented in software on a PC. The verification algorithm is based on a likelihoodratio classifier for Gaussian probability densities. First results indicate that it is feasible to use grip-pattern recognition for biometric verification.",
